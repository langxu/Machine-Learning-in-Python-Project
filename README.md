# Machine-Learning-in-Python-Project
This folder contains all projects I have accomplished during the course.



For each project, please check the project requirement file to get a basic understading of the project. 

Project 1 => 2017 flight data set basic analysis and visulization, with Tsne dimension reduction method.

Project 2 => Skin cancer prediction using image extration method, with PCA/KPCA/RPCA dimension reduction for linear representation images.

Project 3 => 2017 flight data set with multiclass logistic regression analysis 

Project 4 => 2017 flight data set with Multi-layer perceptron algorithm with L1 and L2 regularization and different activation function

Project 5 => 2017 flight data set with wide and deep learning 

Project 6 => Plankton's prediction using CNN

Feel free to let me if there is any improvement I could do for these projects. My email is michaelxu0515@gmail.com

Thanks a lot!
